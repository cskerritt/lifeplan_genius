## Python Code Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 with 120 character line limit.
- Use double quotes for Python strings (ruff enforced).
- Sort imports with isort (via ruff).
- Try to use type hints where possible, but strict type-checking is not enforced and you can leave them out if it's burdensome. There is no need to add type hints to existing code that does not use them.

### Preferred Practices

- Use Django signals sparingly and document them well.
- Always use the Django ORM if possible. Use best practices like lazily evaluating querysets
  and selecting or prefetching related objects when necessary.
- Use function-based views by default, unless using a framework that relies on class-based views (e.g. Django Rest Framework).
- Always validate user input server-side.
- Handle errors explicitly, avoid silent failures.
- Use translation markup, usually `gettext_lazy` whenever using user-facing strings.
